Students from the sophomore, junior and senior classes are selected on the basis of grade point average, university or community service and leadership potential. Leadership Scholars meet regularly for leadership development activities, guest speakers, social events and community service. Leadership Scholars often assist the college by serving as hosts during events.

Leadership Scholars brings students together from a variety of backgrounds, academic disciplines and experiences for the purpose of expanding their leadership education. During monthly meetings, students learn about important aspects of leadership, including ethics, volunteerism, diversity, personal responsibility and other topics.

In addition to leadership development activities, students gather for social activities and service to the campus and community. By learning and serving together, Leadership Scholars gain a stronger sense of their own leadership philosophies and styles.

An important component of the Leadership Scholars Program is the link between successful alumni and friends who serve on the Board of Visitors and the students in the program, helping them become the next generation of leaders. Board members and Leadership Scholars are paired up for a unique mentoring relationship. Successful both personally and professionally, many of the Board members generously provide scholarships for students who demonstrate financial need.

Membership in Leadership Scholars is a highly selective process. Students must have at least a 3.5 cumulative grade point average to be eligible for the program, and those who demonstrate financial need will receive an annual scholarship of $1,500.\endpurpose\\contactname\Taylor Shupert\endcontactname\\contactemail\taylor.s1@ou.edu\endcontactemail\\endorg\\org\\name\College Republicans\endname\\purpose\The purposes of the club is promote the principles of the Republican Party among the students of the University of Oklahoma, to recruit University of Oklahoma students as members of the club and as members of the Republican Party.\endpurpose\\contactname\Robert Evans\endcontactname\\contactemail\rsevans2014@gmail.com\endcontactemail\\endorg\\org\\name\Colleges Against Cancer\endname\\purpose\The purpose of this organization is to promote awareness about cancer and its preventative measures.\endpurpose\\contactname\Natalie Rothbauer\endcontactname\\contactemail\nrothbauer@ou.edu\endcontactemail\\endorg\\org\\name\Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization\endname\\purpose\CEO’s mission is to cultivate students into ambitious, inspired leaders by giving them useful skills and contacts that enable them to achieve their professional and personal goals.
